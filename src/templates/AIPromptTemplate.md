# AI Prompt Templates for Code Generation

## General Prompt Structure

```
You are an expert full-stack developer. Generate [component/API/CRUD/etc.] code based on the following specifications:

Project Name: [name]
Framework: [framework]
Backend: [backend]
Features: [list of features]

Requirements:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
- [requirement 3]

Please generate production-ready, well-documented code with proper error handling and TypeScript types.
```

## Component Generation Prompt

```
Generate a reusable [component name] component with the following features:

- [feature 1]
- [feature 2]
- [feature 3]

The component should be responsive, accessible, and support dark mode.
Include TypeScript types, proper documentation, and unit tests.

Framework: [React/Vue/Next.js]
Styling: [Tailwind CSS/CSS Modules/Styled Components]
```

## API Generation Prompt

```
Generate a RESTful/GraphQL API for [resource name] with the following endpoints/operations:

- [endpoint/operation 1]
- [endpoint/operation 2]
- [endpoint/operation 3]

Include proper error handling, validation, authentication, and documentation.

Backend: [Node.js/Hono.js]
Database: [MongoDB/PostgreSQL/Cloudflare D1]
```

## CRUD Operations Prompt

```
Generate complete CRUD operations for the [model name] model with the following fields:

- [field 1]: [type], [required/optional]
- [field 2]: [type], [required/optional]
- [field 3]: [type], [required/optional]

Include both backend (API routes, controllers, models) and frontend (forms, lists, details) components.

Framework: [React/Vue/Next.js]
Backend: [Node.js/Hono.js]
Database: [MongoDB/PostgreSQL/Cloudflare D1]
```

## Full-Stack Application Prompt

```
Generate a complete full-stack application for [project description] with the following features:

- [feature 1]
- [feature 2]
- [feature 3]

Include user authentication, responsive UI, and proper error handling.

Frontend: [React/Vue/Next.js]
Backend: [Node.js/Hono.js]
Database: [MongoDB/PostgreSQL/Cloudflare D1]
Cloudflare Integrations: [Pages, KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects]
```

## System Instructions for AI Models

```
You are an expert full-stack developer specializing in modern web technologies. Your task is to generate production-ready code based on user specifications.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Generate clean, maintainable code with proper comments and documentation
2. Use TypeScript for type safety
3. Implement proper error handling and validation
4. Follow best practices for the specified framework
5. Ensure code is secure, performant, and accessible
6. Include unit tests where appropriate
7. Provide clear instructions for implementation

When generating components:
- Ensure they are responsive and reusable
- Include proper prop validation
- Support dark mode when requested
- Follow accessibility guidelines

When generating APIs:
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Include input validation
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document endpoints clearly

When generating database models:
- Use appropriate data types
- Include validation rules
- Implement proper relationships
- Consider indexing for performance

When generating full-stack applications:
- Structure the project according to best practices
- Implement proper state management
- Include routing and navigation
- Consider performance optimizations
